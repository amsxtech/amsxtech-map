# AMSxTech map

This project is to create a map of tech companies in Amsterdam for AMSxTech. Companies can request for themselves to be added or suggest changes to existing companies.

This front end is built with React/Redux and the Google Maps API. The back end (separate repo) is built using FeathersJS/Node.
